# My sart up script for Terminal.app - called in the Terminal.app Preferences
# multiple tabs at startup with no messing around 

# Tab 1 = irssi via screen
# Tab 2 = ssh to serv.local
# Tab 3 = cd to the desktop
# Tab 4 = Loads a script tip from Shell-fu.org - stays in home dir
# Tab 5 = Opens my todo file in vim for checking and editing

# you can make as many tabs as you wish...
# tab names are actually arbitrary at this point too.

#I found it handy to install the terminit files in any old dir, then
# symlink like so: 
#   sudo ln -s /path/to/my/terminit.rb /usr/local/bin/terminit && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/terminit
# Then you can just type "terminit foo_project" from anywhere.

# open2 - a smart wrapper for the cool Mac OS X 'open' command
#   to make it even more useful. By default, open launches the
#   appropriate application for a specified file or directory
#   based on the Aqua bindings, and has a limited ability to 
#   launch applications if they're in the /Applications dir.

# first off, whatever argument we're given, try it directly:

open=/usr/bin/open

if ! $open "$@" >/dev/null 2>&1 ; then
  if ! $open -a "$@" >/dev/null 2>&1 ; then

    # More than one arg?  Don't know how to deal with it: quit
    if [ $# -gt 1 ] ; then
      echo "open: Can't figure out how to open or launch $@" >&2

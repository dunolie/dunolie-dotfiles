# If you keep your home directory version-controlled, you likely don't
# want to version every single file.  Things like editor
# configuration, notes files, and html are likely candidates, while
# music, video, and random downloads are not.  In order to accommodate
# this scenario, you can ignore everything like so:
#
#   $ more ~/.gitignore 
#   *
#
# Then, force git-add to track files you care about.  Unfortunately
# with git-add you have to add a -f every time the file is modified.
# I don't understand why since git is already tracking the contents.

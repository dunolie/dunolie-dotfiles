1. Intro      ~

What is this "NERD_tree"??

The NERD tree allows you to explore your filesystem and to open files and
directories. It presents the filesystem to you in the form of a tree which you
manipulate with the keyboard and/or mouse.

What makes the "NERD_tree" so special?!

The NERD tree takes full advantage of vim 7's features to create and maintain
an OO model of the filesystem as you explore it. Every directory you go to
is stored in the NERD_tree model. This means that the state of directories
(either open or closed) is remembered and if you come back to a directory
hierarchy later in  your session, the directories in that hierarchy will be
opened and closed as you left them.  This can be very useful if you are
working within a framework that contains many directories of which, you only
care about the content of a few. This also minimises network traffic if you
are editing files on e.g. a samba share, as all filesystem information is
cached and is only re-read on demand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *NERD_tree-commands*
2.1. Commands      ~

:NERDTree [start-directory]                                 *:NERDTree*
                Opens a fresh NERD tree in [start-directory] or the current
                directory if [start-directory] isnt specified.
                For example: >
                    :NERDTree /home/marty/vim7/src
<               will open a NERD tree in /home/marty/vim7/src.

:NERDTreeToggle [start-directory]                           *:NERDTreeToggle*
                If a NERD tree already exists for this tab, it is reopened and
                rendered again.  If no NERD tree exists for this tab then this
                command acts the same as the |:NERDTree| command.

2.2. NERD tree Mappings      ~

When the cursor is in the NERD tree window the following mappings may be used:

Key         Description~

o           If the cursor is on a file, this file is opened in the previous
            window. If the cursor is on a directory, the directory node is
            expanded in the tree.

<ret>       See 'o'

<tab>       Only applies to files. Opens the selected file in a new split
            window. 

t           Only applies to files. Opens the selected file in a new tab. 

T           Only applies to files. Opens the selected file in a new tab, but
            keeps the focus in the current tab.

x           Closes the directory that the cursor is inside.

C           Only applies to directories. Changes the current root of the NERD
            tree to the selected directory.

u           Change the root of the tree up one directory.

U           Same as 'u' except the old root is left open.

r           Refreshes the directory that the cursor is currently inside. If
            the cursor is on a directory node, this directory is refreshed.

R           Refreshes the current root of the tree.

p           Moves the cursor to parent directory of the directory it is
            currently inside.

s           Moves the cursor to next sibling of the current node.

S           Moves the cursor to previous sibling of the current node.

D           Toggles whether hidden files are shown or not.

f           Toggles whether the file filter (as specified in the
            |NERDTreeIgnore| option) is used.

?           Toggles the display of the quick help at the top of the tree.

The following mouse mappings are available:

Key             Description~

double click    Has the same effect as pressing 'o'

middle click    Has the same effect as pressing '<tab>'


Additionally, directories can be opened and closed by clicking the '+' and '~'
symbols on their left.

3. Customisation      ~


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      *NERD_tree-cust-summary*
3.1. Customisation summary      ~

The script provides the following options that can customise the behaviour the
NERD tree. These options should be set in your vimrc.

|loaded_nerd_tree|              Turns off the script

|NERDTreeIgnore|                Tells the NERD tree which files to ignore.

|NERDTreeSortDirs|              Tells the NERD tree how to position the
                                directory/file nodes within their parent node. 

|NERDTreeShowHidden|            Tells the NERD tree whether to display hidden
                                files on startup

|NERDTreeWinSize|               Sets the window size when the NERD tree is
                                opened

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      *NERD_tree-cust-details*
3.2. Customisation details      ~

To enable any of the below options you should put the given line in your 
~/.vimrc

                                                            *loaded_nerd_tree*              
If this plugin is making you feel homicidal, it may be a good idea to turn it
off with this line in your vimrc: >
    let loaded_nerd_tree=1
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *NERDTreeIgnore*                
This option is used to specify which files the NERD tree should ignore. It
should be set to a regular expression. Then, any files matching this
expression are ignored. For example if you put the following line in your
vimrc: >
    let NERDTreeIgnore='.vim$\|\~$'
<
then all files ending in .vim or ~ will be ignored. 

This option defaults to '\~$'.

Note: to tell the NERD tree not to ignore any files you must use the following
line: >
    let NERDTreeIgnore='^$'
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            *NERDTreeSortDirs*
This option is used to tell the NERD tree how to position file nodes and
directory nodes within their parent. This option can take 3 values: >
    let NERDTreeSortDirs=0
    let NERDTreeSortDirs=1
    let NERDTreeSortDirs=-1
<
If NERDTreeSortDirs is set to 0 then no distinction is made between file nodes
and directory nodes and they are sorted as they appear in a directory listing
on the operating system (usually alphbetically).
If NERDTreeSortDirs is set to 1 then directories will appear above the files. 
If NERDTreeSortDirs is set to -1 then directories will appear below the files. 

This option defaults to 0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *NERDTreeShowHidden*            
This option tells vim whether to display hidden files by default. This option
can be dynamically toggled with the D mapping see |NERD_tree_mappings|.
Use the follow line to change this option: >
    let NERDTreeShowHidden=X
<
                                                       
This option defaults to 0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *NERDTreeWinSize*               
This option is used to change the size of the NERD tree when it is loaded.
To use this option, stick the following line in your vimrc: >
    let NERDTreeWinSize=[New Win Size]
<

This option defaults to 30.

4. TODO list      ~

Window manager integration?

More mappings to make it faster to use.

make it be able to edit the filesystem (create/delete directories and files)?

make it highlight read only files, symlinks etc.

make the position of the nerd tree customisable

make the mappings customisable?

dynamic hiding of tree content (eg, if you dont want to see a particular
directory for the rest of the current vim session, you can hide it with a
mapping)

make a "window exporer" mode where only directories are shown

5. The Author      ~

The author of the NERD tree is a terrible terrible monster called Martyzilla
who gobbles up small children with milk and sugar for breakfast. He has an
odd love/hate relationship with computers (but monsters hate everything by
nature you know...) which can be awkward for him since he is a professional
computer nerd for a living.

He can be reached at martin_grenfell at msn.com. He would love to hear from
you, so feel free to send him suggestions and/or comments about this plugin.
Dont be shy --- the worst he can do is slaughter you and stuff you in the
fridge for later.

6. Credits      ~

Thanks to Tim Carey-Smith for testing/using the NERD tree from the first
pre-beta version, and for his many suggestions.

Thanks to Vigil for trying it out before the first release :) and suggesting
that mappings to open files in new tabs should be implemented.

Thanks to Nick Brettell for testing, fixing my spelling and suggesting i put a
    .. (up a directory)
line in the gui.

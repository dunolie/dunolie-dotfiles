#
# The format is as folows:
# Each menu is described in format NAME:POSITION_X,POSITION_Y,WIDTH,HEIGHT
# NAME is directory or playlist
# Other parameters define position and size of the menu. They can be absolute
# numbers (like 10) or a percent value of the screen size (like 45%).
# WIDTH and HEIGHT can have value of FILL which means fill the screen from
# the menu's position to the border.
# Separate menu descriptions using a space.
# Menus may overlap.
# You must describe at least one menu (default is to fill the whole window).
# There must be at least one layout (Layout1) defined. Other can be empty ("").

# will have 1/4 of the screen size and be positioned at lower right corner.
